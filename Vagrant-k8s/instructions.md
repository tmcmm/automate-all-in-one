**_NOTE:_** Start the VMs using the command `vagrant up`. Depending on the hardware and network connectivity of your machine, this process may take a couple of minutes. After you are done with the exercise, shut down the VMs with the command `vagrant destroy -f`. The Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane node running on `kube-control-plane` and `kube-worker-1`. You can SSH into a VM using the command `vagrant ssh <vm-name>`.
